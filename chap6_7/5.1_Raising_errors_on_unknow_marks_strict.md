When the ```--strict``` command-line flag is passed, any marks not registered in the pytest.ini file will trigger an error.
Marks can be registered like this:

```
[pytest]
markers = 
    slow
    serial
```
This can be used to prevent users mistyping mark names by accident. Test suites that want to enforce this should add ```--strict``` to ```addopts```:
```
[pytest]
addopts = --strict
markers =
    slow
    serial
```
